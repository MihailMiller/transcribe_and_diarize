# transcribe_and_diarize
This script processes audio files by converting them to WAV format, transcribing them, and automatically assigning the speaker sections using Whisper (an open-source speech-to-text tool) and Pyannote.audio (a Python library for speaker diarization). It is particularly suitable for analyzing conversations or interviews.
